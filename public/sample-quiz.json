      "questionText": "In 2-3 sentences, explain the basic concept of photosynthesis.",
      "questionType": "subjective",
      "referenceAnswer": "Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek phōs (light), and synthesis (putting together). In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product.",
      "category": "Science",
      "explanation": "Key elements include the conversion of light energy to chemical energy, the use of carbon dioxide and water as inputs, and the production of sugars/carbohydrates and oxygen.",
